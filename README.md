#HSR notes: You did a good job taking on a dataset that you didn't collect, and learning to code when you could only be in class half of the time. I hope it was helpful for learning how to code, and that you can take some more classes in grad school! Some tips for you: you have two sets of folders - one is the main set, andt he other is under the final project folders. You also have data spread throughout, when it should be in a tidy & a raw folder under the data folder.
