#2) check structure to make sure everything is in correct class
str(fences)
summary(fences)
#3) Subset to the dataset you will use for the analysis
#we will use all of the dataset, but if we were to subset, we would use filter. 
fencesurvkarst <-fencesurv %>%
  filter(soil=="karst")

nrow(fencesurvkarst)#88 observations

# We will make a new column for propalive
fences <- fences %>%
  mutate(propalive = numalive/numseedplant)

#4) Decide which variables are your response variables and which are your predictors
# Response: cbind(numalive, numseedplant) or propalive
# Continuous predictors: distance, centavgopen
# Categorical predictors: species, substrate, open, parent (?) 
# Random effects: island (n=4 usually), site (n=3/island)

############ Data Exploration ##########
#5) try these two functions, from the skimr and DataExplorer packages
skim(fences)

#5a) Look for outliers in continuous response & predictor variables. 
# Use histogram or dotplot, identify outliers

  geom_histogram()

dotchart(fences$propalive) #no outliers
dotchart(fences$centavgopen) #two outliers, both at far distances and both on Guam - maybe should remove?

#5b) Zero-inflation in y variable (for count data)?

##########
# 6a) Collinearity X: correlation between covariates ()
#Plot each predictor against each other (since categorical, can't test this directly)
#Look at relationships of Y vs Xâ€™s to see if homogenous variances at each X value, linear relationships
#Plot response against each predictor and random effect. 
#As long as at least one is continuous, use ggplot (use facet_grid for multiple categorical variables)
#Use summarize or table for two categorical (ftable for more than 2 categories)

#Summary of data exploration

#1: Outliers
#No outliers in response. Some NA's in response- will need to clean this up. 
#Some outliers in canopy (high values)- both are far and on Guam. Should remove from analysis. 
#distance, species and substrate are all categorical. 

#2: Zero-inflation
# 17% zeros. this is distributed unevenly across spp, though, with 56% zeros for papaya.Keep an eye on papaya- low sample size. 

#3: Collinearity: No strong collinearities. Heterogeneity, though. 

#4: Linearity & homogeneity- relationship of Y vs X's. 
# potential nonlinear relationship between centavgopen and propsurvival (saturating?) but maybe the link function will take care of this? 
# heterogeneity in a variety of response factors. 

#5: Independence Y- 
# random effects of site and island warranted. Note- 4 levels of island, 3-5 levels of site within island so many would question this as a random effect because not enough levels. Also, not all spp planted on all islands. 
# temporal correlation: all samples taken at same time, but could look at effect of age of seedlings on prop survival
# I don't think there would be spatial correlation beyond site, but could examine response against latitude. 

#6: Interactions - do we have enough data? 
#Low numbers of papaya, and then have to remove lots bc no soil data. 
#low numbers for some soil:species:island interactions. 
#No neiso planted on Rota, no Psychotria planted on Tinian
#
#decided not to analyze soil relationships because we are missing soil data for a significant number of plants.
